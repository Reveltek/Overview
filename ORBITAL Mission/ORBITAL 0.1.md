# ORBITAL

The ORBITAL Framework is a model that helps businesses and organizations achieve success. It consists of five levels: Galaxy, Super Nova, Super Star, Star, and Droid. 
At the top level, a Galaxy represents an entire business industry. The Super Nova level is when a Star (a company or project) experiences a major event that causes it to turn into a Super Star, also known as a Super Giant. This could be a breakthrough product, a successful marketing campaign, or any other major achievement.
A Super Star is a very large company, powerful department, or highly successful product team. It's a level of success that many businesses aspire to reach. 
A Star represents a company or project that is on its way to success, but still has room for growth and improvement. Finally, a Droid is a series of tasks or smaller projects that are designed to help steer a star or multiple stars towards a Super Nova event.


# Understanding the ORBITAL Framework
This framework appears to be a useful tool for mapping out and understanding the different levels of a business industry, company, or project.

Based on the information you provided, it seems that the ORBITAL Framework is designed to help organizations identify and navigate towards a Super Nova event. This event is triggered by a significant change or breakthrough that causes a Star to transform into a Super Star. It is important to note that this event can be both positive or negative, depending on the circumstances.

Each level of the ORBITAL Framework represents a different scale of operation, with a Galaxy representing an entire business industry and a Droid representing a series of smaller tasks or projects. The Super Star level is reserved for very large companies, powerful departments, or highly successful product teams, while the Star level represents a single company or project.

Overall, the ORBITAL Framework appears to be a valuable tool for organizations looking to understand their place within a larger industry or market and identify opportunities for growth and transformation. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts, organizations can more effectively navigate towards a Super Nova event and achieve long-term success.
